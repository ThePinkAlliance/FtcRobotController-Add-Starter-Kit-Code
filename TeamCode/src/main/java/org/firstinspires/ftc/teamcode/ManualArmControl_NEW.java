/*
 * This OpMode is an example driver-controlled (TeleOp) mode for the goBILDA 2024-2025 FTC
 * Into The Deep Starter Robot
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This robot has a two-motor differential-steered (sometimes called tank or skid steer) drivetrain.
 * With a left and right drive motor.
 * The drive on this robot is controlled in an "Arcade" style, with the left stick Y axis
 * controlling the forward movement and the right stick X axis controlling rotation.
 * This allows easy transition to a standard "First Person" control of a
 * mecanum or omnidirectional chassis.
 *
 * The drive wheels are 96mm diameter traction (Rhino) or omni wheels.
 * They are driven by 2x 5203-2402-0019 312RPM Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotors.
 *
 * This robot's main scoring mechanism includes an arm powered by a motor, a "wrist" driven
 * by a servo, and an intake driven by a continuous rotation servo.
 *
 * The arm is powered by a 5203-2402-0051 (50.9:1 Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotor) with an
 * external 5:1 reduction. This creates a total ~254.47:1 reduction.
 * This OpMode uses the motor's encoder and the RunToPosition method to drive the arm to
 * specific setpoints. These are defined as a number of degrees of rotation away from the arm's
 * starting position.
 *
 * Make super sure that the arm is reset into the robot, and the wrist is folded in before
 * you run start the OpMode. The motor's encoder is "relative" and will move the number of degrees
 * you request it to based on the starting position. So if it starts too high, all the motor
 * setpoints will be wrong.
 *
 * The wrist is powered by a goBILDA Torque Servo (2000-0025-0002).
 *
 * The intake wheels are powered by a goBILDA Speed Servo (2000-0025-0003) in Continuous Rotation mode.

    To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
    First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
    But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
    The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
    reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
    We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
    The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16
    counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. */

    In these variables you'll see a number in degrees, multiplied by the ticks per degree of the arm.
    This results in the number of encoder ticks the arm needs to move in order to achieve the ideal
    set position of the arm. For example, the ARM_SCORE_SAMPLE_IN_LOW is set to
    160 * ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE. This asks the arm to move 160Â° from the starting position.
